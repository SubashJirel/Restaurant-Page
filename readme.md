# Restaurant Page Assignment

This project is a part of the Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this assignment is to create a restaurant homepage using webpack and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm init` in your project directory to generate a `package.json` file.
2. Install webpack and webpack-cli by running `npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev`.
3. Create `src` and `dist` directories in your project.
4. Create an `index.js` file inside the `src` directory.
5. Create an `index.html` file inside the `dist` directory and link the `main.js` file generated by webpack.
6. Create a `webpack.config.js` file similar to the tutorial.
7. Set up an HTML skeleton in `dist/index.html` with a single `<div id="content">`.
8. Write a simple `console.log` or `alert` statement inside `src/index.js` and run `npx webpack`. Test the page in a browser to ensure it's working.
9. Optionally, use `npx webpack --watch` to automatically recompile on changes.

## Project Structure

- `src/` directory: Contains the source code files.
  - `index.js`: Initial JavaScript file with a simple console log.
- `dist/` directory: Contains the compiled and bundled files.
  - `index.html`: HTML skeleton with a `<div id="content">`.

## Assignment Progression

1. Start with a bare-bones homepage for the restaurant in HTML.
2. Include an image, headline, and some copy about the restaurant.
3. Remove hardcoded elements from HTML and create them using JavaScript.
4. Create a separate module for the initial page-load function.
5. Import and call the page-load function in `index.js`.
